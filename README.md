# course-project-omnifood
website built based on Jonas Schmedtmann's course on web design.

## `Difference from the course`
All content is provided by the course. Except the jQuery part of the code is replaced by pure JavaScript.
The scrolling is managed by ScrollMagic with gsap, some scrolling animation is from animate.css.
Instead of using grid.css provided, the site use display flex and grid to manage some section of HTML.
A function is also created to manage the duration offset for scrolling animation caused by change in window size.
Slide menu function is also added to make navigation menu open or close for smaller size window or screen device.
